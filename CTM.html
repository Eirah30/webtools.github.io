				The University of Makati (UMak) is a public, locally funded university of 
				the local government of Makati. It is envisioned as the primary instrument where 
				university education and industry training programs interface to mold Makati and 
				non-Makati youth into productive citizens and IT-enabled professionals who are exposed 
				to the cutting edge of technology in their areas of specialization. UMak is the final 
				stage of Makati City's integrated primary level to tertiary level educational system 
				that enables its less privileged citizens to compete for job opportunities in various 
				businesses and industries.
